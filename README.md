# Background

As a burgeoning startup specializing in machine learning solutions within the European banking market, our focus spans diverse challengesâ€”from fraud detection and sentiment classification to predicting and understanding customer intentions. A central aspect of our mission is developing a robust machine learning system that harnesses insights derived from call center data. Our overarching goal is to significantly enhance the success rate of calls made to customers for various client offerings. In pursuit of this objective, we're actively engaged in designing an ever-evolving machine learning product that not only delivers high success outcomes but also ensures interpretability, empowering our clients to make well-informed decisions.

# Data Description

Our dataset originates from the direct marketing efforts of a European banking institution. The marketing campaign involves making phone calls to customers, often multiple times, to secure product subscriptions, particularly term deposits. Term deposits, characterized by short-term maturities ranging from one month to a few years, necessitate customers to comprehend that funds can only be withdrawn after the term concludes. For privacy concerns, all customer information revealing personal details has been meticulously removed.
